# ConvPoint: Generalizing discrete convolutions for unstructured point clouds


![SnapNet products](./doc/convPoint.png)


## Updates

**Major performance update**: by reformulating the convolutional layer using matrix mulitplications, the memory consumption has been highly reduced.

**Major interface update**: the spatial relations are now computed in the network class. The framework is then easier to use and more flexible.

## Introduction

This repository propose python scripts for point cloud classification and segmentation. The library is coded with PyTorch.

## Platform

The code was tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Anaconda.

## Dependencies

- Pytorch
- Scikit-learn for confusion matrix computation, and efficient neighbors search  
- TQDM for progress bars
- PlyFile
- H5py

All these dependencies can be install via conda in an Anaconda environment or via pip.

## The library

### Nearest neighbor module

The ```nearest_neighbors``` directory contains a very small wrapper for [NanoFLANN](https://github.com/jlblancoc/nanoflann) with OpenMP.
To compile the module:
```
cd nearest_neighbors
python setup.py install --home="."
```

In the case, you do not want to use this C++/Python wrapper. You still can use the previous version of the nearest neighbors computation with Scikit Learn and Multiprocessing, python only version (slower). To do so, add the following lines at the start of your main script (e.g. ```modelnet_classif.py```):
```
from global_tags import GlobalTags
GlobalTags.legacy_layer_base(True)
```
